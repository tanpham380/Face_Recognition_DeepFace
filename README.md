# Face Recognition API 

This project provides a RESTful API for face recognition tasks, including:

- **Registration:** Register new faces with associated unique identifiers (UIDs).
- **Recognition:** Recognize faces in images against a database of registered faces.
- **Verification:** Verify if two images contain the same person.
- **Representation:** Extract face embeddings from images.
- **Analysis:** Analyze images for demographics (age, gender, emotion, race).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- DeepFace
- SQLite (for database)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-api.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd face-recognition-api
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following environment variables:

API_KEY=your_api_key  # Your secret API key for authentication
DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///your_database.db  # Path to your SQLite database file
Replace your_api_key and your_database.db with your desired values.

Running the API
Start the Flask application:

flask run
The API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

API Endpoints
Authentication
All API endpoints require an API key for authentication. The API key is specified in the Authorization header of requests:

Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
Registration
Endpoint: /register Method: POST Parameters:

uid: Unique identifier for the person.
image: Image file to register.
Example Request:

{
  "uid": "user123",
  "image": "path/to/image.jpg"
}
Recognition
Endpoint: /recognize Method: POST Parameters:

image: Image file to recognize.
Example Request:

{
  "image": "path/to/image.jpg"
}
Verification
Endpoint: /verify Method: POST Parameters:

img1_path: Path to the first image.
img2_path: Path to the second image.
Example Request:

{
  "img1_path": "path/to/image1.jpg",
  "img2_path": "path/to/image2.jpg"
}
Representation
Endpoint: /represent Method: POST Parameters:

img_path: Path to the image.
Example Request:

{
  "img_path": "path/to/image.jpg"
}
Analysis
Endpoint: /analyze Method: POST Parameters:

img_path: Path to the image.
actions: List of actions to perform (e.g., ["age", "gender", "emotion", "race"]).
Example Request:

{
  "img_path": "path/to/image.jpg",
  "actions": ["age", "gender", "emotion", "race"]
}
Example Usage
import requests

# Set API key and endpoint
api_key = "your_api_key"
endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"

# Register a new face
files = {'image': open('path/to/image.jpg', 'rb')}
data = {'uid': 'user123'}
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
response = requests.post(endpoint + 'register', files=files, data=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())

# Recognize a face
files = {'image': open('path/to/image.jpg', 'rb')}
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
response = requests.post(endpoint + 'recognize', files=files, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
Notes
The API uses DeepFace for face recognition and analysis.
The database is stored in SQLite.
The API is designed to be scalable and can be deployed to a cloud platform.
The API is still under development and may have limitations.

**Key Improvements:**

- **Clearer Structure:**  The README is organized into sections with headings and subheadings for better readability.
- **Code Blocks:**  Code snippets are formatted using backticks for easy copying and pasting.
- **Example Requests:**  Example JSON requests are provided for each endpoint.
- **Example Usage:**  A Python code example demonstrates how to use the API.
- **Notes:**  Important information about the API is highlighted in a "Notes" section.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Add Screenshots:**  Consider including screenshots of the API in action or of the application's user interface.
- **Provide a Contribution Guide:**  If you want others to contribute to the project, include a "Contributing" section with guidelines.
- **Link to Documentation:**  If you have more detailed documentation, link to it from the README.

By following these suggestions, you can create a README.md file that is both informative and visually appealing.
